                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William Gibson's novel <i> Neuromancer</i> is a work of Cyber Punk ficton.
                The book was published in July of 1984. Neuromancer is the first true work of Cyber Punk literature,
                which is a derivative of Science Fiction. As a Science Ficiton novel, is apart of the early 20th century's Post
                Modern literary movement. Neuromancer is particularly important because of its impact on a post-internet society. 
                The book was very ahead of the 80s and because of this, it actually served as a blueprint for inventors after the book's publishing; 
                Gibson's foresight and imagination is on display in this novel: Cyberspace was a very
                abstract concept at the time, Virtual Reality devices were not even a thought, and Artificial Intelligence was not 
                something to be feared until this book.<p>

                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Henry Dorsett "Case" was a washed out Cyber-Cowboy at the end of his rope as a result of a miscalculation.
                His previous employers poisoned him with a mycotoxin in retaliation for stealing from them. 
                This poising left him unable to use his brain-computer interface to access the global computer network in cyberspace, 
                a virtual reality dataspace called the "Matrix". Case was suicidal, strung out on drugs, 
                and searching desperately for a cure for his nervous system damage; that is until the cure he was looking for found him. 
                <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two people, Molly and Armitage seeked him out and offered him a cure for the nervous system 
                damage in return for his skills. The team recruits people along the way, but the only person knowledgable to the actual plot is Armitage. 
                Molly and Case discover that the heists the two of them have been pulling off are in an effort to merge the AI Wintermute with the AI Neuromancer so that 
                Wintermute and Neuromancer can become the entirety of the matrix. Neuromancer is resistant to Wintermute's efforts and instead of 
                turning against his original objective of joining Wintermute and Neuromancer, Case decided to work towards joining the two in retalition for 
                what Neuromancer made him go through mentally.

                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main themes of <i> Neuromancer</i> include technology (obviously), manipulation, 
                        and the dichomtomy of freedom and confiment. Technology literally rules this world and contributes to the other two. Gibson explores how 
                        he thinks technology will have change the world and humanity in an advanced, dystopian society. Manipulation is explored through the physical
                        and emotional in this novel. How individuals react to the ability to manipulate themeselves and to emotional manipulation because
                        of AI is a frequently explored theme. Gibson sees technology as both limiting and freeing. His characters, again, can expand beyond what 
                        they are naturally capable of thanks to technology, but they also can be held captive mentally by larger powers (AI).

                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The narrator gives a third person view through the perspective of Case. One less often said 
                    yet important symbol for Case is the Shuriken. The Shuriken represnets Case's past, as it is a relic from his time in Chiba City. This 
                    is an important symbol because when Case makes a show of throwing the Shuriken and throwing it at a screen, it is meant to symbolize
                    letting go of the past and how that is a catalyst for change. Molly's eyes are another important symbol for another theme in the book that is 
                    isolation. Eyes and looking into one's eyes exposes how they feel and what they might be thinking. Molly's eyes are vision enhancing mirror shades 
                    which don't allow anyone to see the actual color of her eyes. These reflect how technology isolates individuals.
